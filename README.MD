MLX is a simple, general-purpose Doom launcher built with Avalonia.

The main goal is to be simple, easy to use, and heavily portable (in the sense it can be shoved on a USB stick).

The UI is built to be similar to ZDL, but not have the sub-menus that ZDL had. 
Everything you need is on the main screen.

# Building
