# MLX
MLX is a simple, general-purpose Doom launcher built with Avalonia.

The main goal is to be simple, easy to use, and heavily portable (in the sense it can be shoved on a USB stick).

# Building
## Prerequisites
* [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
* Avalonia

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/CoderPenguin1-dev/MLX.git
```

Move into build directory:
```
cd "MLX/MLX"
```

Build & Run Debug binary:
```
dotnet run
```
It should open up afterwards. The build will be in `MLX\bin\Debug\net9.0`.
